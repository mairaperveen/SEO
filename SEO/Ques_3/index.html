    <!--What are the Benefits of Using Meta Tags?-->
    <h1>Meta Tags</h1>
    <p> Meta tag is a snippet of HTML code that provides metadata about a webpage. Meta tags don't appear on the webpage itself, but they convey information to search engines and browsers about the page's title, description, author, character encoding, and other important details. They play a crucial role in search engine optimization (SEO) and improving a website's visibility and user experience.</p>
